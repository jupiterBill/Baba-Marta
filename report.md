# High Issues

## H-1: Arbitrary `from` passed to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`)

Passing an arbitrary `from` address to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`) can lead to loss of funds, because anyone can transfer tokens from the `from` address if an approval is made.  

- Found in src/MartenitsaMarketplace.sol [Line: 82](src\MartenitsaMarketplace.sol#L82)

	```solidity
	        martenitsaToken.safeTransferFrom(seller, buyer, tokenId);
	```



# Medium Issues

## M-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

- Found in src/HealthToken.sol [Line: 10](src\HealthToken.sol#L10)

	```solidity
	contract HealthToken is ERC20, Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/HealthToken.sol [Line: 19](src\HealthToken.sol#L19)

	```solidity
	    function setMarketAndVotingAddress(address martenitsaMarketplace, address martenitsaVoting) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaEvent.sol [Line: 22](src\MartenitsaEvent.sol#L22)

	```solidity
	    constructor(address healthToken) onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaEvent.sol [Line: 30](src\MartenitsaEvent.sol#L30)

	```solidity
	    function startEvent(uint256 duration) external onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaEvent.sol [Line: 60](src\MartenitsaEvent.sol#L60)

	```solidity
	    function stopEvent() external onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaMarketplace.sol [Line: 8](src\MartenitsaMarketplace.sol#L8)

	```solidity
	contract MartenitsaMarketplace is Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaToken.sol [Line: 7](src\MartenitsaToken.sol#L7)

	```solidity
	contract MartenitsaToken is ERC721, Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaToken.sol [Line: 28](src\MartenitsaToken.sol#L28)

	```solidity
	    function setProducers(address[] memory _producersList) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaVoting.sol [Line: 8](src\MartenitsaVoting.sol#L8)

	```solidity
	contract MartenitsaVoting is Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaVoting.sol [Line: 34](src\MartenitsaVoting.sol#L34)

	```solidity
	    function startVoting() public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaVoting.sol [Line: 57](src\MartenitsaVoting.sol#L57)

	```solidity
	    function announceWinner() external onlyOwner {
	```



## M-2: Using `ERC721::_mint()` can be dangerous

Using `ERC721::_mint()` can mint ERC721 tokens to addresses which don't support ERC721 tokens. Use `_safeMint()` instead of `_mint()` for ERC721.

- Found in src/HealthToken.sol [Line: 32](src\HealthToken.sol#L32)

	```solidity
	        _mint(to, amountToMint);
	```



# Low Issues

## L-1: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

- Found in src/MartenitsaEvent.sol [Line: 52](src\MartenitsaEvent.sol#L52)

	```solidity
	        (bool success) = _healthToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), healthTokenRequirement);
	```



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in src/HealthToken.sol [Line: 2](src\HealthToken.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.21;
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaEvent.sol [Line: 2](src\MartenitsaEvent.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.21;
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaMarketplace.sol [Line: 2](src\MartenitsaMarketplace.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.21;
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaToken.sol [Line: 2](src\MartenitsaToken.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.21;
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaVoting.sol [Line: 2](src\MartenitsaVoting.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.21;
	```



## L-3: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/HealthToken.sol [Line: 2](src\HealthToken.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.21;
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaEvent.sol [Line: 2](src\MartenitsaEvent.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.21;
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaMarketplace.sol [Line: 2](src\MartenitsaMarketplace.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.21;
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaToken.sol [Line: 2](src\MartenitsaToken.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.21;
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaVoting.sol [Line: 2](src\MartenitsaVoting.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.21;
	```



# NC Issues

## NC-1: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

- Found in src/HealthToken.sol [Line: 20](src\HealthToken.sol#L20)

	```solidity
	        _martenitsaMarketplace = MartenitsaMarketplace(martenitsaMarketplace);
	```

- Found in src/HealthToken.sol [Line: 21](src\HealthToken.sol#L21)

	```solidity
	        _martenitsaVoting = MartenitsaVoting(martenitsaVoting);
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaEvent.sol [Line: 23](src\MartenitsaEvent.sol#L23)

	```solidity
	        _healthToken = HealthToken(healthToken);
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaMarketplace.sol [Line: 30](src\MartenitsaMarketplace.sol#L30)

	```solidity
	        healthToken = HealthToken(_healthToken);
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaMarketplace.sol [Line: 31](src\MartenitsaMarketplace.sol#L31)

	```solidity
	        martenitsaToken = MartenitsaToken(_martenitsaToken);
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaVoting.sol [Line: 27](src\MartenitsaVoting.sol#L27)

	```solidity
	        _martenitsaMarketplace = MartenitsaMarketplace(marketplace);
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaVoting.sol [Line: 28](src\MartenitsaVoting.sol#L28)

	```solidity
	        _healthToken = HealthToken(healthToken);
	```



## NC-2: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

- Found in src/HealthToken.sol [Line: 19](src\HealthToken.sol#L19)

	```solidity
	    function setMarketAndVotingAddress(address martenitsaMarketplace, address martenitsaVoting) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaToken.sol [Line: 28](src\MartenitsaToken.sol#L28)

	```solidity
	    function setProducers(address[] memory _producersList) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/MartenitsaVoting.sol [Line: 34](src\MartenitsaVoting.sol#L34)

	```solidity
	    function startVoting() public onlyOwner {
	```
